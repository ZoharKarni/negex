Forked from chapmanbe/negex.

negex.py -- A python module to implement Wendy Chapman's NegEx algorithm.

A code that mark the negation of medical expressions in sentences.
Unlike the original repository, this one doesn't require ground truth of the negation - it will simply return "Negated" if the expression is negated or "Affirmed" if it is not.
Another addition - this code also works in the Hebrew language.
